                <div>
                    A quick explanation of the project, Stonegate's approach and our solution. The purpose is to communicate some of the overarching “whys” and what people should keep their eyes open for in general. Think of this section as 'setting the tone and voice of the site.'

                <div>
                    Stonegate's grid, general layout positioning and block placements. Where are certain global elements are positioned, what’s the horizontal spacing and how are columns (if there are any) handled are all questions answered here. This is also where wifeframes can be included.

                    What fonts are used and why they were chosen, and some examples of the implementation to offer context for the greater specificity to come.

                    Text links, primary navigation, drop-downs, sub nav, navigational buttons, the search box … really anything that enables the user to find their way around the site is covered here. Link colors, treatments, text-decoration and more detail is found here.

                    Headings (h1, h2, h3), lists, deck copy, button text, forms, fieldsets, tables and so on. A comprehensive list that can be refered back to on every project to ensure that we are covering our bases. Having a consistent system will save time and the headache of having to do something twice on a project.

                    What are the image and video proportions throughout the site? Did you use a standard ratio? Are there image cache settings that you need to consider, etc.

                    This is where it really gets into the granular detail. The devil is in the details. Every bit of customization that couldn’t adequately be covered by the previous seven sections should be fleshed out here. How will different block elements be handled when in unique situations? What about those side bar adverts or the search results page after a failed search? What will comments look like when threaded or linear? How will photo galleries look and function throughout the site?

                <div>
                    Bringing it all together, this is one giant canvas or HTML page that has every element with every state displayed. The purpose of this portion of the guide is twofold: a quick reference for developers to grab elements for implementation and a place to check to see that all the elements fit together in perfect harmony.

                    The foundational deliverables that have been produced on earlier projects – items such as the sitemap, wireframes, screenshots of prototypes with links to them if they’re live, and personas. Often these earlier deliverables have helped and continue to help define the functionality, purpose and interactions of the Stonegate sites.
