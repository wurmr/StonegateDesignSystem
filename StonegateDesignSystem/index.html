                <div>
                    A quick explanation of the project, your approach and your solution. Here’s your chance to communicate some of the overarching “whys” and what people should keep their eyes open for in general. It’s the perfect time to set the tone and voice of the site. This is where you can talk a bit about the content strategy for the project.

                <div>
                    Your grid, general layout positioning and block placements. Where are certain global elements positioned, what’s the horizontal spacing and how are columns (if there are any) handled are all questions to answer here. This is also where your wifeframes should be included.

                <div>
                    This isn’t where I’d cover the specific sizes of the type. I’d just explain what fonts are used and why they were chosen, and provide some examples of the implementation to offer context for the greater specificity to come.

                    Text links, primary navigation, drop-downs, sub nav, navigational buttons, the search box … really anything that enables the user to find their way around the site should be covered here. We’re starting to arrive at a much higher level of detail. Link colours, treatments, text-decoration and more should be spelled out here. Remember, it may seem clear to you, but I operate under the assumption that it isn’t obvious. I want design decisions made by designers and I want coding decisions made by coders. It makes sense.

                <div>
                    Headings (h1, h2, h3), lists, deck copy, button text, forms, fieldsets, tables and so on. It’s nice to have a comprehensive list that you refer back to on every project to ensure that you cover your bases. Again, having a consistent system will save you time and the headache of having to do something twice on a project.

                <div>
                    Unless you’re in the pre-1994 coding era (what do you mean, you don’t know about Netscape?), you’ve probably included various types of media in your design. Well, what are the image and video proportions throughout the site? Did you use a standard ratio? Are there image cache settings that you need to consider based on the CMS your client will be using? OK, that last one is a bit geeky, but it happens on most projects I work on, so I always keep it in mind.

                    This is where it really gets into the granular detail and you need to dig deep to finish. The devil is in the details. Every bit of customisation that couldn’t adequately be covered by the previous seven sections must be fleshed out here. How will different block elements be handled when in unique situations? What about those side bar adverts or the search results page after a failed search? What will comments look like when threaded or linear? How will photo galleries look and function throughout the site? Even at this stage it’s important to look for possible repeating patterns or elements. We don’t want to completely blow the budget.

                <div class="sectionHeading">09. Interface harmony canvas</div>
                <div>
                    Bringing it all together, this is one giant canvas or HTML page that has every element with every state displayed. If you’re able to include code snippets or have them added as the project progresses, that’s a huge bonus. The purpose of this portion of the guide is twofold: a quick reference for developers to grab elements for implementation and a place to check to see that all the elements fit together in perfect harmony.

                    I know this is a bit of a broad title, but it’s a broad area to cover. It’s important to include the foundational deliverables that have been produced earlier in the project – items such as the sitemap, wireframes, screenshots of prototypes with links to them if they’re live, and personas. Often these earlier deliverables have helped and continue to help define the functionality, purpose and interactions of the site.
